# Homebrew tools repository

This repository serves as a Homebrew tap for:

  * [rq](rq.rb) — Record Query - A tool for doing record analysis and transformation (see <https://github.com/dflemstr/rq>)
  * [v8](v8.rb) — A version of `v8` that is most appropriate for `rq`.

`v8` packaging shamelessly copied almost verbatim from https://github.com/pinepain/packaging
